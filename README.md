# Next Blog

This is the latest iteration of bayphillips.com. It's built with:

* Next.js
* Sanity.io
* Tailwindcss

And hosted on:

* Vercel
* Cloudflare

I used the blog template starter and will continue customizing it.

## Clawdbot Integration

This project is Clawdbot-ready and can be worked on using the Clawdbot AI assistant. Here's how Clawdbot can help with this Next.js blog:

### Development Workflow
- **Code Generation**: Create new React components, pages, and API routes
- **Content Management**: Work with Sanity CMS schemas and content
- **Styling Updates**: Modify Tailwind CSS classes and design systems
- **Testing**: Write and run Jest tests and Playwright e2e tests
- **Git Operations**: Create branches, commit changes, and manage pull requests

### Getting Started with Clawdbot
1. Clone the repository: `gh repo clone bayphillips/next-blog`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start development: `npm run dev`
4. Ask Clawdbot to help with specific tasks or features

### Example Clawdbot Commands
- "Add a new blog post component with dark mode support"
- "Update the Sanity schema to include a new author field"
- "Write tests for the navigation component"

### Project Structure Understanding
Clawdbot can analyze and work with:
- Next.js App Router structure (`app/` directory)
- Sanity CMS configuration and schemas (`sanity/` directory)
- Component library (`components/` directory)
- Utility functions (`lib/` directory)
- Testing setup and configurations

The project includes comprehensive tooling that Clawdbot can leverage for development, testing, and deployment workflows.
